# DL-Based Solution for Detection of Face-Swap Deep Fake Photos

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a deep learning-based solution for detecting face-swap deep fake images. With the rapid rise of social media platforms, fake or edited images are increasingly being used to spread misinformation, causing significant harm. Our goal is to create an efficient image classification system capable of accurately identifying deep fake images. This solution can be scaled for real-world applications, ensuring robustness and efficiency in terms of both computational and memory usage.

## Problem Statement

With the rise of social media, individuals can share and disseminate photos globally within seconds. However, this has given rise to the propagation of manipulated or fake images, including deep fakes, which can mislead users and contribute to the spread of misinformation. The problem is amplified by the increasing sophistication of deep fake technology, making it difficult for the human eye to detect forgeries.

Our solution uses deep learning to detect fake images by analyzing image data and predicting whether an image is real or manipulated. We have decided to deploy in online. It's something that can be rethought and changed, but generally knowing the problem (and the target variable to be predicted) already gives us an idea which style of deployment will generate more value for the business.

## Data Acquisition

Our dataset comprises a mix of publicly available resources for real and deep fake images. However, due to computational constraints, we performed **weighted sampling** to create a manageable dataset for training purposes. Below are the links to the data sources we utilized:

1. **[deepfake and real images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjilkarki/deepfake-and-real-images?resource=download)** - This dataset contains manipulated images and real images. The manipulated images are the faces which are created by various means. Each image is a 256 X 256 jpg image of human face either real or fake.
2. **[Real and Fake Face Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ciplab/real-and-fake-face-detection)** - This dataset contains expert-generated high-quality photoshopped face images. The images are composite of different faces, separated by eyes, nose, mouth, or whole face.
3. **[140k Real and Fake Faces](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xhlulu/140k-real-and-fake-faces)** - This dataset consists of all 70k REAL faces from the Flickr dataset collected by Nvidia, as well as 70k fake faces sampled from the 1 Million FAKE faces (generated by StyleGAN) that was provided by Bojan.

## Data Preparation

We have designed a comprehensive data pipeline to process our dataset, including steps for data cleaning, preprocessing and sampling. The entire pipeline ensures a smooth flow of data from raw input to model-ready formats.

## User Interface

A key part of our project is the user-facing interface, which allows end users to easily upload images and receive predictions about their authenticity.

**User Interface Screenshot:**

The UI is designed to be intuitive, with a clean layout where users can upload an image and view results in real-time. It includes a dashboard to visualize key statistics and confidence scores generated by the models.
