# DL-Based Solution for Detection of Face-Swap Deep Fake Photos

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a deep learning-based solution for detecting face-swap deep fake images. With the rapid rise of social media platforms, fake or edited images are increasingly being used to spread misinformation, causing significant harm. Our goal is to create an efficient image classification system capable of accurately identifying deep fake images. This solution can be scaled for real-world applications, ensuring robustness and efficiency in terms of both computational and memory usage.

## Problem Statement

With the rise of social media, individuals can share and disseminate photos globally within seconds. However, this has given rise to the propagation of manipulated or fake images, including deep fakes, which can mislead users and contribute to the spread of misinformation. The problem is amplified by the increasing sophistication of deep fake technology, making it difficult for the human eye to detect forgeries.

Our solution uses deep learning to detect fake images by analyzing image data and predicting whether an image is real or manipulated. We have decided to deploy in online. It's something that can be rethought and changed, but generally knowing the problem (and the target variable to be predicted) already gives us an idea which style of deployment will generate more value for the business.

## Data Sources

Our dataset comprises of two publicly available datasets - [CIFAKE](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/cifake-real-and-ai-generated-synthetic-images) and the other one is a custom dataset given in MesoNet's paper which can be downloaded from [here](https://my.pcloud.com/publink/show?code=XZLGvd7ZI9LjgIy7iOLzXBG5RNJzGFQzhTRy).


We plan to further train our models on these further datasets in future. We didn't due to lack of compute.

1. **[deepfake and real images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjilkarki/deepfake-and-real-images?resource=download)** - This dataset contains manipulated images and real images. The manipulated images are the faces which are created by various means. Each image is a 256 X 256 jpg image of human face either real or fake.
2. **[Real and Fake Face Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ciplab/real-and-fake-face-detection)** - This dataset contains expert-generated high-quality photoshopped face images. The images are composite of different faces, separated by eyes, nose, mouth, or whole face.
3. **[140k Real and Fake Faces](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xhlulu/140k-real-and-fake-faces)** - This dataset consists of all 70k REAL faces from the Flickr dataset collected by Nvidia, as well as 70k fake faces sampled from the 1 Million FAKE faces (generated by StyleGAN) that was provided by Bojan.

## Model Development

We developed three models for detecting deep fake images, each leveraging state-of-the-art techniques in computer vision and deep learning. These models were benchmarked to provide a robust baseline and ensure continuous improvement through iterative testing.

1. **MesoNet: a Compact Facial Video Forgery Detection Network**
   *Authors:* Afchar, D., Nozick, V., Yamagishi, J., Echizen, I. (2018)
   *[Link to Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.00888)*  
   *Description:* This paper presents a method to automatically and efficiently detect face tampering in videos, and particularly focuses on two recent techniques used to generate hyper-realistic forged videos: Deepfake and Face2Face.
   
2. **Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer Using Shifted Windows**
   *Authors:* Liu, Z., Lin, Y., Cao, Y., Hu, H., Wei, Y., Zhang, Z., & Lin, S. (2021)  
   *[Link to Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14030)*
   *Description:*  The Swin Transformer introduces a novel hierarchical vision transformer that leverages shifted windows for efficient computation. By partitioning the image into non-overlapping windows and shifting them at each layer, it improves both local and global representation learning, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on various computer vision tasks, including image classification and object detection.

3. **Deepfake Detection with Deep Learning: Convolutional Neural Networks versus Transformers**  
   *Authors:* Vrizlynn L. L. Thing (2024)  
   *[Link to Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03698)*
   *Description:*
   This paper explores the rapid evolution of deepfake creation technologies and investigates the effectiveness of deep learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, for detecting deepfakes. The author identifies and develops eight promising deep learning architectures, testing them on various well-established deepfake datasets, including FF++, Google DFD, Celeb-DF, Deeper Forensics, and DFDC. The study achieves impressive results, with detection accuracies and AUC scores of up to 100% on several datasets, while also analyzing the strengths of CNNs and Transformers in deepfake detection and cross-dataset evaluations.

## User Interface

A key part of our project is the user-facing interface, which allows end users to easily upload images and receive predictions about their authenticity.

**User Interface Screenshot:**

The UI is designed to be intuitive, with a clean layout where users can upload an image and view results in real-time. It includes a confidence score generated by the models.
